content
	slides, bullets, pictures. It is an outline.
	three to five bullets on a slide(often short phrases or words).
	pictures engage brains, quick break, istockphoto, flickr. filter, creative commons 	license, sort by interest. not too big, relevant. helps remember the talk.
	jokes and stories are awesome. Never offend someone.
	tell experiences. hang memories, framework. nothing better than a story to 		illustrate a point.

Goal? share, Reach, Change. Write, speak, teach.
Who is this about? Audience!
Filter everything. offend -> lose
